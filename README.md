# **SWIPE**
At the University of Oklahoma, recruiting students for research projects is challenging and time-consuming for students and principal investigators (PIs) alike. Frequently, OU faculty or PIs receive tens of emails from students seeking research and academic internship opportunities and students scout the various websites within their colleges or outside in other institutions. This becomes a tedious task and often valuable opportunities are missed or remain unfilled.

SWIPE (name under development) is a swipe-based, cross-platform, mobile app that matches students with faculty members/PIs based on their preferences and areas of interest. Students submit their general interests, and faculty submit the general needs for their research projects and labs. A customized user screening experience allows both parties to swipe or mark shortlists, exchange application materials, and submit CVs and resumes. This app will change the paradigm of the recruitment process for the OU research institutions, accelerating the process by ensuring that less obvious matches are found.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

0. make sure you are cd'd into swipe_exop

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app
   I think I made this work with just '''npm run start''' if you have a AVM open

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
   

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project 
   since this is just the fresh template that expo makes, we can use this if we mess something up while messing around(I havn't tested this yet):

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
