# **SWIPE**
At the University of Oklahoma, recruiting students for research projects is challenging and time-consuming for students and principal investigators (PIs) alike. Frequently, OU faculty or PIs receive tens of emails from students seeking research and academic internship opportunities and students scout the various websites within their colleges or outside in other institutions. This becomes a tedious task and often valuable opportunities are missed or remain unfilled.

SWIPE (name under development) is a swipe-based, cross-platform, mobile app that matches students with faculty members/PIs based on their preferences and areas of interest. Students submit their general interests, and faculty submit the general needs for their research projects and labs. A customized user screening experience allows both parties to swipe or mark shortlists exchange application materials, and submit CVs and resumes. This app will change the paradigm of the recruitment process for the OU research institutions, accelerating the process by ensuring that less obvious matches are found.
