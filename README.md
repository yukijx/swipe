# **SWIPE**
At the University of Oklahoma, recruiting students for research projects is challenging and time-consuming for students and principal investigators (PIs) alike. Frequently, OU faculty or PIs receive tens of emails from students seeking research and academic internship opportunities and students scout the various websites within their colleges or outside in other institutions. This becomes a tedious task and often valuable opportunities are missed or remain unfilled.

SWIPE (name under development) is a swipe-based, cross-platform, mobile app that matches students with faculty members/PIs based on their preferences and areas of interest. Students submit their general interests, and faculty submit the general needs for their research projects and labs. A customized user screening experience allows both parties to swipe or mark shortlists, exchange application materials, and submit CVs and resumes. This app will change the paradigm of the recruitment process for the OU research institutions, accelerating the process by ensuring that less obvious matches are found.

## **About the Project**
- **Tech Stack**: 
- **REACT NATIVE** will be used for cross-platform app development using Typescript and React. This front end will work in conjunction with the Expo framework.
- **EXPO** is compatible with iOS, Android, and the web browser. The framework has a lot of APIs that will help facilitate development. It also allows you to test the app on your phone instantly by scanning a QR code instead of building the app every time. You can test the app on a browser, giving us a variety of platforms to view the changes on our codebase. 
- **JSON-SERVER** is a temporary database solution before we transition to SQLite. 
- **SQLite** provides portable local storage for a mobile app; this means that the data can be accessed even if the app is offline.  

---

## **Features**
- **Customizable User Filtering**: Students can filter and sort opportunities tailored to their needs and preferences.
- **Swipe or Mark Shortlists**: Students can quickly shortlist opportunities with a swipe or marking mechanism for easy tracking. Faculty and PIs can mark student profiles that have expressed interest in their research projects. 
- **Exchange and Submit Application Materials**: Seamlessly exchange application materials directly through the platform, including CVs and resumes.
- **Comprehensive Student Profiles**: Students can submit resumes and build detailed profiles showcasing their academic and professional achievements.
- **Faculty-Specific Features**: Faculty members can create profiles highlighting their research, provide detailed information about job postings (e.g., required experience, technical knowledge, offered pay rate), and manage applications effectively.

# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

0. make sure you are cd'd into swipe_exop

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app
   I think I made this work with just '''npm run start''' if you have a AVM open

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
   

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project 
   since this is just the fresh template that expo makes, we can use this if we mess something up while messing around(I havn't tested this yet):

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
